Instructions:

0; clone https://github.com/vrsttl/zurich-backend and follow the instructions there

1; add `.env` for this project

2; `yarn install`

3; `yarn start`

For `master` branch
.env should be precisely:

```
EXTEND_ESLINT=true
```
for `v2.0` branch please add
```
NODE_ENV=development
```
for a complete make-believe experience, though the app will work as intended also if you don't :)

If you decide to check v2.0 out, please also use the corresponding branch on backend.
